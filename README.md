# Analysis of Land Surface Temperature (LST) across Varying Urban Land Covers in Minneapolis, Minnesota

There are three main goals of this project.

1. To determine and quantify the relationships between land cover and land surface temperature (LST), a key variable that will allow for an examination of the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect across the City of Minneapolis.
2. To specifically examine the role that green spaces play in combatting UHI effects in the study area.
3. To create a method to run ANOVA in Python with summary statistics as the only input.
